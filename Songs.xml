    <artist>WilGen</artist>
    <lyrics>1.
All I need,
All my life is You, my Lord.
There's nothing more I want
Than to be with You.

Lord, all I want,
All my life is to give myself to You,
That I may be a servant like You.

All You wanted,
All Your life was to serve me, Lord.
You give Yourself to me unselfishly.

You know, my Lord,
I have nothing to give You in return,
But here I am, I am Yours.

Chorus:
Make me Your servant, O Lord.
I want to follow Your footsteps.
Show me Your way.

Open my eyes, cleanse my heart, take my life.
Use me, Lord, for I am Your servant.
[2]
[Chorus]

    <artist>Charlie Cenzon</artist>
    <lyrics>O Diyos, Ikaw ang laging hanap,
Loob ko’y Ikaw ang tanging hangad.
Nauuhaw akong parang tigang na lupa
Sa tubig ng Iyong pag-aaruga.

Nang makita ko ang Iyong pagkarangal.
Dadalangin akong nakataas ang aking kamay,
Magagalak na aawit ng papuring iaalay.

Refrain:
Gunita ko’y Ikaw habang nahihimlay,
Pagkat ang tulong Mo sa tuwina’y taglay.
Sa lilim ng Iyong mga pakpak,
Umaawit akong buong galak.

Aking kaluluwa’y kumakapit sa Iyo,
Kaligtasa’y tiyak kung hawak Mo ako.
Magdiriwang ang hari, ang Diyos Siyang dahilan;
Ang sa Iyo ay nangako, galak yaong makakamtan. [REFRAIN]</lyrics>

Turuan Mo akong maglingkod sa Iyo;
Na magbigay nang ayon sa nararapat,
Na walang hinihintay mula sa Iyo.

Mga hirap na dinaranas;
Sa tuwina’y magsumikap na hindi humahanap
Ng kapalit na kaginhawaan.

Na ’di naghihintay kundi ang aking mabatid
Na ang loob Mo’y siyang sinusundan.

Panginoon, turuan Mo ako maging bukas-palad,
Turuan Mo akong maglingkod sa Iyo;
Na magbigay nang ayon sa nararapat,
Na walang hinihintay mula sa Iyo.

    <lyrics>I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
I will celebrate the wonder of Your name
For the word that You speak is a song of forgiveness
And a song of gentle mercy and of peace

Let us wake at the morning and be filled with Your love
And sing songs of praise all our days
For Your love is as high as the heavens above us
And Your faithfulness as certain as the dawn

I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord
For You are my refuge and my strength
You fill the world with Your life-giving Spirit
That speaks Your word, Your word of mercy and of peace

Pangayoon ta kini nga grasya
Gikan Niya.

Apan ang tawo’ng naminaw
Sa mga Pulong sa Ginoo,
Ug walay ipamatuod
Diha sa iyang mga buhat.

Sama siya sa tawong
Nagtukod ug balay sa yutang huyang.
Sa kusog nga ulan pagabanlason
Ug sa hangin pagatumpagon.

Pulong ni Kristo ug buhat mo
Ang haligi sa pagtoo.
Ampingi kining grasya

    <title>MGA GANGHAAN (SALMO 24B)</title>
    <artist />
    <lyrics>Mga ganghaan, pasudlang
Hari sa himaya!
Kinsa kining Hari sa kahimayaan?
Ang gamhanan sa panggubatan,
Nga mibuntog sa tanan,
Dios sa kagahuman.

Kinsay makasaka sa Iyang santos nga bukid,
Ug mobarug sa Iyang atubangan?
Kadtong putli ang mga kamot,
Kansang kasingkasing mahinlo.
Kadtong Iyang pinalanginan,
Linain sa mga kaliwatan,
Nga nangita sa dagway sa Dios ni Hakob.</lyrics>

    <lyrics>Mugna sa Dios ako karon nagpakata-kos,
Sa pakig-atubang, dalang akong kahuyang
Ug ang pagpaubos.

Bunga sa yuta ug ginama sa kamot sa tawo,
Halad sa ulipon, pinaagi Niya
Ang Ginoo pagadaygon.

//
Lawas ug kalag,
Kining mahal Mo nga hatag,
Sa kanunay mahalon ug sa dayon,
Dayon sa grasya (kanunay ko) palamboon.

    <lyrics>Where can I run and hide from You,
Or could I ever do,
When everywhere I know You're there,
Anywhere You'll find me?

Where could I go to flee from You,
Or could I ever do,
When Your hands keep holding me,
Guiding me, around me?

Chorus:
God, I know that You are there.
You know who I am and all I do.
God, You see me through and through.
Take my hand, I trust in You.
I put my life in You.

You know me when I sit or stand,
My life is in Your hand.
You read my thoughts from far away,
In everything You know me.

You know me in my darkest hour,
You give me strength and power.
You are there beside me,
Watching me for always. [Chorus]

For all the wonders that You gave me,
For all the marvels that You do,
For all of this, I’d like to thank You
And praise You.

    <title>NICENE CREED (BISAYA)</title>
    <artist />
    <lyrics>Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Dios,
Ang Amahan, ang makagagahum sa tanan,
Magbubuhat sa langit ug sa yuta,
Ug sa tanang mga makita ug dili makita.

Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Ginoo, si Jesu Kristo,
Ang bugtong Anak sa Dios,
Gianak sa Amahan sa wala pa’y katuigan.
Dios gikan sa Dios, kahayag gikan sa kahayag,
Matuod nga Dios gikan sa Dios nga matuod,
Gianak, dili binuhat,
Usa’g kinaiya sa Amahan.
Pinaagi Kaniya nangahimo ang tanan,
Tungod kanatong mga tawo ug alang sa atong kaluwasan.

Mikanaog Siya gikan sa langit,
Sa lalang sa Espiritu Santo,
Nahimo Siyang lawas gikan ni Maria nga ulay
Ug nahimong tawo.

Tungod kanato gilansang Siya sa krus
Sa sugo ni Poncio Pilato,
Nag-antos Siya, namatay ug gilubong.
Sa ikatulong adlaw nabanhaw Siya
Aron matuman ang Kasulatan.

Misaka Siya sa langit
Ug nagalingkod sa too sa Amahan.
Mubalik Siya nga mahimayaon
Aron paghukom sa mga buhi ug sa mga minatay,
Ug ang Iyang gingharian walay katapusan.

Nagatoo ako sa Espiritu Santo,
Ang Ginoo ug Maghahatag sa kinabuhi.
Nagagikan Siya sa Amahan ug sa Anak.
Dungan sa Amahan ug sa Anak,
Gisimba Siya ug gihimaya,
Ug misulti pinaagi sa mga propeta.

Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Santos,
Katoliko ug Apostoliko nga Simbahan.
Nagaila ako sa usa ka bunyag
Alang sa kapasayloan sa mga sala.
Nagapaabot ako sa pagkabanhaw sa mga minatay,
Ug sa kinabuhi sa umaabot nga kalibutan.

Amen.</lyrics>

    <title>NICENE CREED (ENGLISH)</title>
    <artist />
    <lyrics>I believe in one God,
The Father almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth,
Of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
The Only Begotten Son of God,
Born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
True God from true God,
Begotten, not made,
Consubstantial with the Father;
Through Him all things were made.

For us men and for our salvation
He came down from heaven, (all bow)
And by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
And became man.

For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
He suffered death and was buried,
And rose again on the third day
In accordance with the Scriptures.

He ascended into heaven
And is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
To judge the living and the dead
And His kingdom will have no end.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
The Lord, the giver of life,
Who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
Who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
Who has spoken through the prophets.

I believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
And I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
And the life of the world to come. Amen.</lyrics>

Nor the arrow that flies by day;
Though thousands fall about you,
Near you it shall not come. [Chorus]

To guard you in all of your ways;
Upon their hands they will bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone. [Chorus]</lyrics>

Who left his land in search for graceless souls.

Faithful Child of God,
Be to us a guide.
Lead us to the light of Jesus Christ.

Look down on us from where you are.

Steadfastly you walk where Jesus trod,
Never mindful of what‘s left behind.
We entrust the young to your watchful care,
Walk with them and never leave their side.

You chose to die with Padre Diego,
But your faith in God remains undying.
Be to us a true companion
When at the end death closes in. [Chorus]</lyrics>

I am the Word that leads all to freedom
I am the peace the world cannot give
I will call your name, embracing all your pain
Stand up, now, walk, and live [Chorus]</lyrics>
