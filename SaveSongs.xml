    <Title>A SERVANT LIKE YOU</Title>
    <Artist>WilGen</Artist>
    <Lyrics>1.
All I need,
All my life is You, my Lord.
There's nothing more I want
Than to be with You.

Lord, all I want,
All my life is to give myself to You,
That I may be a servant like You.

2.
All You wanted,
All Your life was to serve me, Lord.
You give Yourself to me unselfishly.

You know, my Lord,
I have nothing to give You in return,
But here I am, I am Yours.

Chorus:
Make me Your servant, O Lord.
I want to follow Your footsteps.
Show me Your way.

Open my eyes, cleanse my heart, take my life.
Use me, Lord, for I am Your servant.
[2]
[Chorus]

Coda:
Take me, Lord, make me, Lord,
A servant like You, like You.
Make me Your servant.</Lyrics>

    <Title>ALAY SA DIYOS</Title>
    <Artist>Manoling Francisco</Artist>
    <Lyrics>O Diyos, awang ’di mabilang,
Tanggapin Mo yaring aming alay;
Gawin ito bilang tanda
Ng aming kaligtasan.

Koro:
Narito, O Ama, alak at tinapay,
Bunga ng lupa at ng aming paggawa.

O Diyos, awang ’di mabilang,
Tanggapin Mo yaring aming alay;
Gawing alaala ng pagkamatay,
Muling pagkabuhay ni Hesukristo. [KORO]

O Diyos, awang ’di mabilang,
Tanggapin Mo yaring aming alay;
Sa bisa nitong sakripisyo,
Mapasa amin ang buhay na walang hanggan. [KORO]</Lyrics>
