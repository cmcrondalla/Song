    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>Wa’y sama ang gugma sa Dios alang Kanimo,
Kinabuhi giula aron ka maluwas.

//
Kalapasan, kadautan sa tawo gipapas.
Pasaylo ug gugma gihatag sa Dios.

Duol Kaniya kay mamati Siya,
Ug salig sa Iyang gugma.

Kinabuhi, tan-awa ang Dios, pamatia,
Kanunay maghari Siya.
//

Hinaot, Ginoo, Imong pamation.</Lyrics>

Kalinaw nga Iyang kabilin,
Kabaskug sa kalag. [Koro]</Lyrics>

    <Title>THE MAJESTY AND GLORY</Title>
    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>F: When I gaze into the night skies
and see the work of your fingers;
U: The moon and stars suspended in space.

Oh, what is man (Oh what is man) that you are mindful of him?
You have given man a crown of glory and honor, 
And have made him a little lower than the angels.
You have put him in charge of all creation:

M: The beasts of the field,
F: The birds of the air, M: The fish of the sea.
But, what is man? Oh, what is man that you are mindful of him?

O Lord, our God, the majesty and glory of your name 
Transcends the earth and fills the heavens.
O Lord, our God; little children praise You perfectly,
And so would we, And so would we.

// Alleluia! Alleluia!
The majesty and glory of Your name. //

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! (Alleluia!)

    <Title>ST. PEDRO CALUNGSOD</Title>
    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>There was once a lad from the Visayas
Who left his land in search for graceless souls.
He spread God‘s words with lips untiring,
He is the servant of the Lord.

Chorus:
O Saint Pedro Calungsod,
Faithful Child of God,
Be to us a guide.
Lead us to the light of Jesus Christ.

O Saint Pedro Calungsod,
Our young inspire in the darkest hour.
Look down on us from where you are.

Steadfastly you walk where Jesus trod,
Never mindful of what‘s left behind.
We entrust the young to your watchful care,
Walk with them and never leave their side.

You chose to die with Padre Diego,
But your faith in God remains undying.
Be to us a true companion
When at the end death closes in. [Chorus]</Lyrics>

I lay them down before You, O Lord.
All my regrets, all my acclaims,
The joy and the pain, I’m making them Yours.

Refrain:
Lord, I offer my life to You,
Everything I’ve been through, use it for Your glory.
Lord, I offer my days to You,
Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice.
Lord, I offer You my life.

Things in the past, things yet unseen,
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true.
All of my hopes, all of my plans,
My heart and my hands are lifted to You. [REFRAIN]

    <Title>HESUS</Title>
    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>Kung nag-iisa at nalulumbay
Dahil sa hirap mong tinataglay,
Kung kailangan mo ng karamay,
Tumawag ka at Siya‘y naghihintay.

Koro 1:
Siya ang iyong kailangan,
Sandigan, kaibigan mo.
Siya ang araw at gabi
At karamay kung sawi.
Siya ay si Hesus sa bawat sandali.

Kung ang buhay mo ay walang sigla,
Laging takot at laging alala.
Tanging kay Hesus makakaasa,
Kaligtasan, lubos ang ligaya.

Koro 2:
Siya ang dapat tanggapin
At kilalanin sa buhay mo.
Siya noon, bukas, ngayon,
Sa dalangin mo‘y tugon.
Siya ay si Hesus sa habang panahon.

Kaya‘t ang lagi mong pakatatandaan,
Siya lang ang may pag-ibig na tunay,
Pag-ibig na tunay.

(Ulitin ang Koro 2 maliban sa huling linya)

Siya ay si Hesus, Siya ay si Hesus,
Siya ay si Hesus, sa habang panahon.</Lyrics>

Kinsa kining Hari sa kahimayaan?
Ang gamhanan sa panggubatan,

Dios sa kagahuman.

Kinsay makasaka sa Iyang santos nga bukid,
Ug mobarug sa Iyang atubangan?
Kadtong putli ang mga kamot,
Kansang kasingkasing mahinlo.
Kadtong Iyang pinalanginan,
Linain sa mga kaliwatan,
Nga nangita sa dagway sa Dios ni Hakob.</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>We felt Your word burning within us,
Your word unlocked the hardness of our hearts
And opened our eyes that we may see You,
Hidden in the broken bread.

Chorus:
Lord, You laid down Your life; as bread and wine we see.
Gave strength to our hearts and made us shine with glee.
When we eat the bread and drink the cup of wine,
We believe that Christ in us, He’s our hope of glory.

You brought a ray of light
And You rekindled our hope,
And led our hearts to yearn for Your love,
For in You is our hope of glory. [CHORUS]


Bridge:
Through Your own flesh now made living,
And by the Spirit made life-giving,
You offer life to us.
And as Your sweat became like drops of blood
Falling down upon the ground,
You shed Your blood for us. Amen. [CHORUS]</Lyrics>

Manalig ka, tuyuin ang luha sa mga mata.
Hindi Siya panaginip, hindi Siya isang pangarap.

At ngayo’y tila walang mararating na bukas,
Ngunit kung Siya’y hahayaang maglandas,
Pag-asa ay muling mabibigkas.

Chorus II:
Manalig ka, tuyuin ang luha sa mga mata.

And when the strong winds blow it won't fall down
As one in Him we'll grow and the whole world will know

At any cost unselfishly
And our home must be a place that fully abounds with grace
A reflection of His face [Chorus]</Lyrics>

Ikaw ang aking Tanging Yaman
Na di lubusang masumpungan.
Ang nilikha Mong kariktan,
Sulyap ng ’Yong kagandahan.

Ika’y hanap sa t'wina,
Nitong pusong Ikaw lamang ang saya.
Sa ganda ng umaga,
Nangungulila sa’yo sinta. [Chorus]

Ika’y hanap sa t'wina,
Sa kapwa ko Ika’y laging nadarama.
Sa Iyong mga likha,
Hangad pa ring masdan ang ’Yong mukha. [Chorus]</Lyrics>

Pray one Our Father, one Hail Mary, one Glory Be

    Our Father...
    Hail Mary...
    Glory Be...

Opening Prayer for Personal Reflection

Heavenly Father,
I come to you with heart full of reverence,
glorifying Your name, and embracing
Your call to renewal and reconciliation
in this Jubilee Year.

As I walk as pilgrim of hope
and pray to You today,
guide my thoughts,
fill my heart with Your peace,
renew my spirit that I may grow closer to You
and live as witness of Your love.
Amen.

(Stay in silence for personal prayer.)

Closing Prayer

Almighty and ever-living God,
With grateful heart, I thank You
for the gift of this Jubilee,
for Your endless mercy, and for the blessings
You pour into our lives.

Through the intercession of
the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints,
may this Jubilee bring healing and peace,
uplift the weary, unite the divided,
and bring light to those in darkness.

Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

THE JUBILEE PRAYER

Father in heaven,
may the faith You have given us
in Your Son, Jesus Christ, our brother,
and the flame of charity enkindled
in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
reawaken in us the blessed hope
for the coming of Your Kingdom.

May Your grace transform us
into tireless cultivators
of the seeds of the Gospel.
May those seeds transform from within
both humanity and the whole cosmos,
in the sure expectation
of a new heaven and a new earth,
when, with the powers of evil vanquished,
Your glory will shine eternally.

May the grace of the Jubilee
reawaken in us, Pilgrims of Hope,
a yearning for the treasures of heaven.
May that same grace spread
the joy and peace of our Redeemer
throughout the earth.

To You, our God, eternally blessed,
be glory and praise for ever.
Amen.</Lyrics>

Or could I ever do,
When everywhere I know You're there,
Anywhere You'll find me?

Guiding me, around me?

My life is in Your hand.
You read my thoughts from far away,
In everything You know me.

You know me in my darkest hour,
You give me strength and power.
You are there beside me,
Watching me for always. [Chorus]

For all the wonders that You gave me,
For all the marvels that You do,
For all of this, I’d like to thank You

O come, divine Messiah!
The world in silence waits the day
When hope shall sing its triumph
And sadness flee away.

Dear Savior, haste!
Come, come to earth.
Dispel the night and show Your face,
And bid us hail the dawn of grace. [Chorus]

O Christ, whom nations sigh for,
Whom priest and prophet long foretold,
Come break the captive fetters,
Redeem the long-lost fold. [Chorus]</Lyrics>

Longing for light, we wait in darkness.
Longing for truth, we turn to You.

Light for the world to see.

Shine in our hearts. Shine through the darkness.
Christ, be our light!
Shine in Your church gathered today.

Longing for water, many still thirst.
Make us Your bread, broken for others,

Longing for warmth, many are cold.
Make us Your building, sheltering others,
Walls made of living stone. [Chorus]

Many the hearts that yearn to belong.
Let us be servants to one another,
Making Your kingdom come. [Chorus]</Lyrics>

    <Title>NICENE CREED (ENGLISH)</Title>
    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>I believe in one God,
The Father almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth,
Of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
The Only Begotten Son of God,
Born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
True God from true God,
Begotten, not made,
Consubstantial with the Father;
Through Him all things were made.

For us men and for our salvation
He came down from heaven, (all bow)
And by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
And became man.

For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
He suffered death and was buried,
And rose again on the third day
In accordance with the Scriptures.

He ascended into heaven
And is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
To judge the living and the dead
And His kingdom will have no end.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
The Lord, the giver of life,
Who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
Who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
Who has spoken through the prophets.

I believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
And I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
And the life of the world to come. Amen.</Lyrics>

Ug sa Diosnong paghigugma.

O Maria, Rayna sa Pilipinas,
Panalipdi kami sa mga katalagman,
Agaka kami ngadto sa Manluluwas,
Si Kristo nga Anak mo ug ang among kagawasan.

Ug paminawa kining among mga pag-ampo,
Nga gikan gayud sa kasingkasing namo:
Mga pagtuaw, panlimbasug ug pagpangaliyupo,
Luwasa kami sa dayong kasubo. [Koro]</Lyrics>

As we journey through this life
Searching for each meaning

One life sharing in love
I will hold you forever
Yes, I love you with all my life

There'll be many questions
As we live life day by day

But this will never matter
If we'll always be there
We'll surely find the answer

    <Artist></Artist>
    <Lyrics>Ang si kinsa nga naminaw
Sa mga Pulong sa Ginoo,
Ipamatuod sa buhat
Sa kinabuhi mo.

Kay sama ka gayud
Sa usa ka tawong maalamon
Nga nagatukod sa iyang balay
Sa usa ka dakong bato.

Chorus:
Bisan sa kusog nga unos
Ug walay hunong nga ulan,
Hangin nga makusog,
Magpabilin kini nga dili matarug.

Sama unta niini ang kalig-on
Sa pagtoo sa kada tawo.
Pangayoon ta kini nga grasya
Gikan Niya.

Apan ang tawo’ng naminaw
Sa mga Pulong sa Ginoo,
Ug walay ipamatuod
Diha sa iyang mga buhat.

Sama siya sa tawong
Nagtukod ug balay sa yutang huyang.
Sa kusog nga ulan pagabanlason
Ug sa hangin pagatumpagon.

Pulong ni Kristo ug buhat mo
Ang haligi sa pagtoo.
Ampingi kining grasya
Nga gihatag Niya sa kinabuhi mo.

Everywhere I go, in all I do and say
Standing close beside me, there to guide me day by day
Is One who knows my heart, all my silent fears

And in His presence I am strong
As I make His word my law
As I learn to live by every truth He teaches me
And my confidence grows sure
As I keep my spirit pure
And let virtue garnish all my thoughts unceasingly

Every test I face, I will overcome
As the Lord upholds me and enfolds me in His love
For He knows my needs; He will walk with me
Comfort and protect me, and direct me patiently

    <Lyrics>Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Dios,
Ang Amahan, ang makagagahum sa tanan,
Magbubuhat sa langit ug sa yuta,
Ug sa tanang mga makita ug dili makita.

Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Ginoo, si Jesu Kristo,
Ang bugtong Anak sa Dios,
Gianak sa Amahan sa wala pa’y katuigan.
Dios gikan sa Dios, kahayag gikan sa kahayag,
Matuod nga Dios gikan sa Dios nga matuod,
Gianak, dili binuhat,
Usa’g kinaiya sa Amahan.
Pinaagi Kaniya nangahimo ang tanan,
Tungod kanatong mga tawo ug alang sa atong kaluwasan.

Mikanaog Siya gikan sa langit,
Sa lalang sa Espiritu Santo,
Nahimo Siyang lawas gikan ni Maria nga ulay
Ug nahimong tawo.

Tungod kanato gilansang Siya sa krus
Sa sugo ni Poncio Pilato,
Nag-antos Siya, namatay ug gilubong.
Sa ikatulong adlaw nabanhaw Siya
Aron matuman ang Kasulatan.

Misaka Siya sa langit
Ug nagalingkod sa too sa Amahan.
Mubalik Siya nga mahimayaon
Aron paghukom sa mga buhi ug sa mga minatay,
Ug ang Iyang gingharian walay katapusan.

Nagatoo ako sa Espiritu Santo,
Ang Ginoo ug Maghahatag sa kinabuhi.
Nagagikan Siya sa Amahan ug sa Anak.
Dungan sa Amahan ug sa Anak,
Gisimba Siya ug gihimaya,
Ug misulti pinaagi sa mga propeta.

Nagatoo ako sa usa ka Santos,
Katoliko ug Apostoliko nga Simbahan.
Nagaila ako sa usa ka bunyag
Alang sa kapasayloan sa mga sala.
Nagapaabot ako sa pagkabanhaw sa mga minatay,
Ug sa kinabuhi sa umaabot nga kalibutan.

Got to keep on plodding onwards with your precious load.

Little donkey, little donkey, had a heavy day.

Muling pagkabuhay ni Hesukristo. [KORO]

Tanggapin Mo yaring aming alay;
Sa bisa nitong sakripisyo,
Mapasa amin ang buhay na walang hanggan. [KORO]</Lyrics>

    <Title>HOW LOVELY</Title>
    <Artist>Johannes Brahms</Artist>
    <Lyrics>Chorus:
How lovely is Your dwelling place,
O Lord, mighty God, Lord of all.

1:
Even the lowly sparrow finds a home for her brood,
And the swallow a nest for herself,
Where she may lay her young
At Your altars, my King and my God. [CHORUS]

2:
Blessed are they whose dwelling is Your own, Lord of peace.
Blest are they, refreshed by springs and by rain,
When dryness daunts and scathes.
Behold my shield, my King and my God! [CHORUS]

3:
I would forsake a thousand other days anywhere,
If I could spend one day in Your courts,
Belonging to You alone.
My strength is You alone,
My glory, my King and my God! [CHORUS]</Lyrics>

Upon their hands they will bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone. [Chorus]</Lyrics>

    <Title>LEAD ME, LORD</Title>
    <Artist>Basil Valdez</Artist>
    <Lyrics>F: Blessed are the poor in spirit, longing for their Lord,
For God’s coming kingdom shall be theirs.
M: Blessed are the sorrowing,
For they shall be consoled,
And the meek shall come to rule the world.

Refrain:
Lead me, Lord, lead me, Lord, by the light of truth,
To seek and to find the narrow way.
Be my way; be my truth; be my life, my Lord,
And lead me, Lord, today.

F: Blessed are the merciful, for mercy shall be theirs,
(Mercy shall be theirs)

And the pure in heart shall see their God.
(they shall see their God)

M: Blest are they whose hunger only holiness can fill,
(Holiness can fill)

For I say they shall be satisfied.
(They shall be satisfied)
 [REFRAIN]

Acapella:
F: Blest are they who through their lifetimes sow the seeds of peace;
All will call them children of the Lord.
M: Blest are you, though persecuted in your holy life,
All: For in heaven, great is your reward.  [REFRAIN]

And lead me, Lord, today.
(Lead me, Lord, O lead me, Lord) (2×)
And lead me, Lord… today.</Lyrics>

    <Title>AWIT NG PAGHAHANGAD</Title>
    <Artist>Bukas Palad</Artist>
    <Lyrics>O Diyos, Ikaw ang laging hanap,
Loob ko’y Ikaw ang tanging hangad.
Nauuhaw akong parang tigang na lupa
Sa tubig ng Iyong pag-aaruga.

Kita’y pagmamasdan sa dakong banal
Nang makita ko ang Iyong pagkarangal.
Dadalangin akong nakataas ang aking kamay,
Magagalak na aawit ng papuring iaalay.

Refrain:
Gunita ko’y Ikaw habang nahihimlay,
Pagkat ang tulong Mo sa tuwina’y taglay.
Sa lilim ng Iyong mga pakpak,
Umaawit akong buong galak.

Aking kaluluwa’y kumakapit sa Iyo,
Kaligtasa’y tiyak kung hawak Mo ako.
Magdiriwang ang hari, ang Diyos Siyang dahilan;
Ang sa Iyo ay nangako, galak yaong makakamtan. [REFRAIN]</Lyrics>
